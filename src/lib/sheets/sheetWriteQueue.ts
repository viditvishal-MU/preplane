 * Queue a sheet write that the user-flow shouldn't block on. The event row is

 *
 * This is the fix for "Create LMP sheet insert fails with no retry" — instead
 * of fire-and-forget we always have a row to retry from.

 * `getHeaderRow`, `TABS`, and `TabName` imports remain so re-enabling later is
 * a single-commit revert.
